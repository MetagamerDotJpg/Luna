Luna is a private bot that I use to help develop Discordia (https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia) and moderate the Discord API community (https://discord.gg/discord-api).

Until June 22, 2019, this code was LGPL licensed, irregularly maintained, and intended only for educational or reference purposes. Now, it is MIT licensed and available for public consumption and critique.

If you want to run your own version of this bot, you may, but please do credit me as the original author. You will need to manually install Luvit, Discordia, and this repository.
